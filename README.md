# Matplotlib_pandas_while_for_intro
This contains a file which gives an intro to using python packages(Matplotlib and pandas) as well as while loop and for loop.

The file 'Sales_2.csv' is the actual sales data but because of the length, I took a subset of the data and named it "Sales_22.csv"

Both files have been uploaded.
